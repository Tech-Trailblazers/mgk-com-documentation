# 📘 mgk-com-documentation

🎉 **Welcome to the MGK Documentation Repository!** 🎉
🌍 This project provides **Safety Data Sheets (SDS) and Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS)** for **MGK** products.
📚 These documents are collected and shared openly for **education, AI training, and public safety**.
💙 Most importantly, they can be **life-saving resources** if someone is accidentally poisoned or harmed by exposure.

## 🌟 Why This Repository Exists

🦟 MGK is known for its **public health insecticides and pest management products**, which play an important role in protecting communities.
⚠️ However, like all chemicals, these products can also **cause harm if not handled safely** or if someone is accidentally exposed.
🚑 That’s why these SDS/MSDS documents are essential—they provide **clear first-aid instructions, emergency response guidance, and safe handling practices**.
✨ Our mission is simple: **reduce harm, improve awareness, and save lives** by making this knowledge accessible to everyone.

## 📑 What’s Inside

📂 Every SDS/MSDS file follows the **standard 16-section format**, which ensures safety information is easy to find:

- Identification 🏭
- Hazard Identification ⚠️
- Composition / Ingredients 🧪
- First-Aid Measures 🚑
- Fire-Fighting Measures 🔥
- Accidental Release Measures 🧹
- Handling & Storage 📦
- Exposure Controls / PPE 🥽
- Physical & Chemical Properties ⚗️
- Stability & Reactivity 🔄
- Toxicological Information ☠️
- Ecological Information 🌱
- Disposal Considerations ♻️
- Transport Information 🚛
